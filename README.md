# ConfigMgrCBDsc

This module contains DSC resources for the management and
configuration of Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager Current Branch (ConfigMgrCB).

Current Branch starts after System Center 2012 with version 1511 [Configuration Manager CurrentBranch](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/core/plan-design/changes/what-has-changed-from-configuration-manager-2012).

Starting with version 1910 Configuration Manager is now part of [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/core/understand/introduction).

This module has been tested on the following versions:

- Configuration Manager 2006
- Configuration Manager 2002
- Configuration Manager 1906
- Configuration Manager 1902

**Note**

ConfigMgrCBDsc module uses the ConfigurationManager module that is installed with
Configuration Manager.  In order to use this module, the site needs to be
registered and the certificate needs to be in the Trusted Publishers store.
Import-ConfigMgrPowerShellModule, adds keys to the HKEY_Users hive and imports
the signing certificate from the ConfigurationManager.psd1 to allow the module
to function, as either LocalSystem, or PSDscRunAsCredential specified.

This occurs in Get, Test, and Set. The function that is called in the resources
is Import-ConfigMgrPowerShellModule.
