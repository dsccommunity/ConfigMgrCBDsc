# ConfigMgrCBDsc

This module contains DSC resources for the management and
configuration of Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager Current Branch (ConfigMgrCB).

Current Branch starts after System Center 2012 with version 1511 [Configuration Manager CurrentBranch](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/core/plan-design/changes/what-has-changed-from-configuration-manager-2012).

Starting with version 1910 Configuration Manager is now part of [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/core/understand/introduction).

This module has been tested on the following versions:

- Configuration Manager 2006
- Configuration Manager 2002
- Configuration Manager 1906
- Configuration Manager 1902

**Note**

ConfigMgrCBDsc module uses the ConfigurationManager module that is installed with
Configuration Manager.  In order to use this module, the site needs to be
registered and the certificate needs to be in the Trusted Publishers store.
Import-ConfigMgrPowerShellModule, adds keys to the HKEY_Users hive and imports
the signing certificate from the ConfigurationManager.psd1 to allow the module
to function, as either LocalSystem, or PSDscRunAsCredential specified.

This occurs in Get, Test, and Set. The function that is called in the resources
is Import-ConfigMgrPowerShellModule.

## ReverseDsc

Most organizations using this module already have an existing Configuration Manager
environment. Creating a configuration and a PowerShell data file that contains
all of the configurations of an environment, to either stand-up a lab environment
or document a production environment, can be a time consuming task to undertake.
ReverseDsc with-in the ConfigMgrCBDsc module will assist in documenting the
current production or development environment and allow you to take that configuration
and allow you to monitor your current settings or rebuild another environment with
the core functionality quickly using the same settings that are currently set within
the Configuration Manager environment.

Typically, with ReverseDsc you will get a configuration that has all of the data
hard coded within the configuration. With this module, it will generate a data file
and if desired a Configuration that will reference the data file to generate a mof
file. This allows you to only have to modify the data file for each of your environments,
production or Lab, and use the same configuration file for each environment.

**Note**

**No passwords are gathered by ReverseDsc. Items such as CMAccounts will only list
the account and when the configuration is ran a prompt will be provided to provide
the password for the account.

With the default configuration created, it does NOT use certificates and all passwords
specified will be in plain text in the mof file when it is compiled.
If desired, once the configuration is created you can add the necessary pieces
to encrypt the passwords in the mof file.**

If looking to stand-up a brand new environment, an example of installing pre-reqs,
SQL, and installing Configuration Manager can be found in examples: PrimaryInstall.ps1.
Using the information in the example can assist with setting up a brand new environment
and using the output from ReverseDsc to quickly stand up a new test environment.

### Importing the ReverseDsc module

The ConfigMgrCBDsc module will have to be installed to run ReverseDSC. ReverseDSC
uses the helper function and each module to gather the information about the
environment. After installing the module, next the ReverseDsc module will need to
be imported, replace `<version>` with the version number of currently installed module:

```powershell
Import-Module -Name 'C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\ConfigMgrCBDsc\<version>\Modules\ConfigMgrCBDsc.ReverseDsc\ConfigMgrCBDsc.ReverseDsc.psd1'
```

After importing the module, Set-ConfigMgrCBDscReverse will be available.

### Set-ConfigMgrCBDscReverse

- **[String] SiteCode** _(Key)_: Specifies the Site Code for the Configuration
  Manager site.
- **[String] Include** _(Write)_: Specifies which resources will be invoked,
  default setting: All.
  - Values include: { All|Accounts|AdministrativeUser|AssetIntelligencePoint|BoundaryGroups|
  ClientPush|ClientStatusSettings|CollectionEvaluationComponent|Collections|
  DistributionGroups|DistributionPoint|DistributionPointGroupMembers|EmailNotificationComponent|
  FallbackPoints|ForestDiscovery|HeartbeatDiscovery|MaintenanceWindow|ManagementPoint|

  ClientSettingsSoftwareDeployment|ClientSettingsSoftwareInventory|ClientSettingsSoftwareMetering|
  ClientSettingsSoftwareUpdate|ClientSettingsStateMessaging|
  ClientSettingsUserDeviceAffinity|SiteConfiguration }
- **[String] Exclude** _(Write)_: Specifies which resources will be excluded from
  being evaluated. Only evaluated when Include = 'All'
  - Values include: { Accounts|AdministrativeUser|AssetIntelligencePoint|BoundaryGroups|
  ClientPush|ClientStatusSettings|CollectionEvaluationComponent|Collections|
  DistributionGroups|DistributionPoint|DistributionPointGroupMembers|EmailNotificationComponent|
  FallbackPoints|ForestDiscovery|HeartbeatDiscovery|MaintenanceWindow|ManagementPoint|
  NetworkDiscovery|PullDistributionPoint|PxeDistributionPoint|GroupDiscovery|

  ClientSettingsCompliance|ClientSettingsComputerAgent|ClientSettingsDelivery|ClientSettingsHardware|
  ClientSettingsMetered|ClientSettingsPower|ClientSettingsRemoteTools|ClientSettingsSoftwareCenter|
  ClientSettingsSoftwareDeployment|ClientSettingsSoftwareInventory|ClientSettingsSoftwareMetering|
  ClientSettingsSoftwareUpdate|ClientSettingsStateMessaging|
  ClientSettingsUserDeviceAffinity|SiteConfiguration }
- **[String] DataFile** _(Write)_: Specifies where the data file will be saved.
  Filename must end with .psd1. Not specifying DataFile the output will be displayed
  in the output screen only if Include does not equal ConfigFileOnly.
- **[String] ConfigOutputPath** _(Write)_: Specifies where the configuration file
  will be saved. Filename must end with .ps1.
- **[String] MofOutPutPath** _(Write)_: Specifies where the mof file will be saved
  when running the configuration.

### Set-ConfigMgrCBDscReverse Examples

Running ReverseDsc with all options and creating a configuration file.

```powershell
$params = @{
    SiteCode         = 'Lab'
    Include          = 'All'
    DataFile         = 'C:\temp\datafile.psd1'
    ConfigOutputPath = 'C:\temp\CMConfig.ps1'
    MofOutputPath    = 'C:\temp\Mof'
}
Set-ConfigMgrCBDscReverse @params
```

Running ReverseDsc using exclude and not creating a configuration file.
This will still create a DataFile containing all of the information retrieved.

```powershell
$params = @{
    SiteCode = 'Lab'
    Include  = 'All'
    Exclude  = 'SiteSystemServer'
    DataFile = 'C:\temp\datafile.psd1'
}
Set-ConfigMgrCBDscReverse @params
```

Running ReverseDsc and only creating a configuration file. DataFile and
MofOutputPath are still required. The reason is when the configuration is
created, it hard codes the path into the configuration file.

```powershell
$params = @{
    SiteCode         = 'Lab'
    Include          = 'ConfigFileOnly'
    DataFile         = 'C:\temp\DataFile.psd1'
    ConfigOutputPath = 'C:\temp\CMConfig.ps1'
    MofOutputPath    = 'C:\temp\Mof'
}
Set-ConfigMgrCBDscReverse @params
```

After creating a DataFile and configuration file, to compile the mof
one additional command will need to be ran. After running the command
below, any item that requires a password, example CMAccounts, will
prompt to enter a password for those accounts. If running against and
environment already up and running, the passwords are not evaluated and set
if the account already exists with a password.

```powershell
C:\temp\CMConfig.ps1
```
